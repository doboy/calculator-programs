# Calculator Programs

## About

Hi, I my name is Zack and welcome to my Github page. I am a software engineer, who started out learning how to program on the TI-83/84 calculators back when I was in high school. Here are some of my most notable programs. If you find value in my work, consider donating to show your appreciation.

### Unit Circle Cheat Sheet

<img alt="unit-circle.gif" src="/calculator-programs/resources/unit-circle/screenshots/unit-circle.gif" width="384"/>

This program displays the sin(θ) and cos(θ) values for common angles in the unit circle for the four quadrants. To get tan(θ) just divide sin(θ) by cos(θ).

How to
* To run the program press PRGM then press UNTCRCLE
* Program will display angles from 0' to 180' or 0 to π press enter to see angles from 180 to 360 or π to 2π
* Press enter one more time to exit the program
* If you exit by pressing OFF/ON then your axes will be turned off and your functions will be turned off
* To turn back axes press "2nd Format" then switch "Axes On"
* To turn functions back on press "Y=" and hover over the plus signs, press "Enter" while on a plus sign
* There are two version of this program based on what calculator you have. If you download the wrong one the text might be displayed squished or out of window.

### Triangle Solver

![Which case you have](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/ss/798/79873.gif)
![Solved](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/ss/798/79874.gif)
![Solved Ambiguous case](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/ss/798/79875.gif)

This program finds missing sides and angles given 3 parts of a triangle. The program will ask you which sides and angles are given. The possible values are A, B, and C. The possible angles are α, β and γ. A is the side opposite to A, β is the side opposite to B, and γ is the side opposite to C. Additional, this program also solves common cases such as right triangles and equilateral triangles. When solving for the case "A,B,α" there is a possible ambiguous case where 2 triangles are given.

How to
* To run the program press PRGM then press TRIANGLE
* It will then ask you for the triangle case you have
* After selecting the case, it will then ask you for the values of the sides and angles
* The program then will display the solved triangle is possible
* This is currently only supported for the TI-83/84 calculator version and not the CE
